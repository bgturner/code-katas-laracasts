# Tennis Scoring

This Kata is meant to score a tennis match. So for example, if `player1` has15 points and `player2` has 0 points, it would be expressed as "Fifteen-Love". Other representations of scores are as follows:

```
1-0 => Fifteen-Love
2-0 => Twenty-Love
3-0 => Thirty-Love
4-0 => Winner
4-3 => Advantage Player
4-4 => Deuce

1-1 => Fifteen-All
2-2 => Thirty-All
```

One cool aspect of this screencast was the demonstration of using `constructors` within the `phpspec` test class.
